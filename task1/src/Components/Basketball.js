          I have many hobbies, and basketball is one of the hobbies I have.
          Basketball is sport that requires personal skill, team work and speed.
          Basketball is a great sport, I enjoy every time when I crossover the
          opponent, and then I score. Team work is one of the important key for play
          basketball.

        I was introduced to basketball as one of the compulsory sports in our school. We used to have one session every week for the sport. Slowly, I started developing an interest in the sport. I then also took extra coaching on Sundays. Then the coach saw potential in me and asked me to join the school's basketball team.
