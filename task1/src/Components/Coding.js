        When you're coding, you are always learning and challenging yourself due to the non-repeating nature of the tasks! While creating a program or app, you constantly expand your understanding of the problem and the solution, trying out new frameworks, solving tricky issues with new algorithms, and using a different methodology. All this results in stretching your mind and improving your patience, perseverance, and discipline. In brief, coding may obviously push you outside of your comfort zone, but in a good way!

        I had an interest in coding/programming since childhood. I was fascinated by how we can make computer to do complex things for us just by writing a few lines of code. We were introduced to HTML & CSS in class 6, but then I did not know it is also a form of coding. During the summer vacations after class 10 I started learning Web Development in more depth with the help of some YouTube courses. I then learnt React in the recent winter vacations.
